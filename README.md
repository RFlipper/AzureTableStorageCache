# AspNetCache-AzureTableStorage
Use azure table storage for AspNet 5 Distributed Cache.

Azure Table Storage is a very cheap, super fast key value store, and its much cheaper than the redis cluster in azure. This is not a true replacement for redis, and redis should be used if people have money, but this is designed to get people a very cheap cache in azure.
